#### Overview

This is a webapp built on top of the MEAN stack for data visualization of an IoT system focused on monitoring air quality in the Philippines to be broadcast to the public.

On the hardware side, a remote air quality sensing device is built using an Arduino microcontroller kit, a GSM module for data transmission, and gas sensors to measure CO, NOx, and C6H6 concentrations.
